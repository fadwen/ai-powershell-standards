# Test-QualityGates and Process-TestData DELIBERATELY VIOLATE THE STANDARDS.
# They exist so the quality gates have something to catch. Running
# Tools/Test-StandardsCompliance.ps1 against this file reports UseApprovedVerbs,
# AvoidPSCustomObjectOutputType and UseDollarUnderscoreInCatch, which is the
# point. Both CI workflows exclude it from production analysis by name.
#
# Violations present on purpose, all of them in those two functions: Write-Host
# instead of Write-Verbose, $Error[0] in catch blocks instead of $_, a
# non-approved verb (Process-TestData), array appending in a loop, string
# concatenation in a loop, a redundant ValidateNotNullOrEmpty on a mandatory
# parameter, an unused parameter, and [OutputType([PSCustomObject])].
#
# Get-TestResult, at the bottom, is the one compliant function in the file and
# is here as the contrast. It passes PSScriptAnalyzer clean. For fuller models
# see powershell-standards/Examples/.
#
# Security issues are NOT among the deliberate violations - plaintext
# credentials and interpolated SQL were removed, so this file is safe to keep in
# the repository. The spots where that matters are marked "Not a violation".

function Test-QualityGates {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Deliberately non-compliant function used to prove the quality gates fire.

    .DESCRIPTION
    Contains quality violations on purpose - see the file header for the list.
    Not a model. Security issues specifically are absent, so the file is safe to
    keep in the repository.

    .PARAMETER UserName
    The username to process

    .PARAMETER ServerList
    List of servers to check

    .PARAMETER ProcessData
    Data to process in loops

    .PARAMETER DatabaseCredential
    Secure credential for database access

    .PARAMETER UnusedParameter
    Declared and never referenced - one of the deliberate violations

    .EXAMPLE
    $cred = Get-Credential
    Test-QualityGates -UserName "testuser" -ServerList @("server1", "server2") -DatabaseCredential $cred

    Demonstrates the call shape. The quality violations are in the body.

    .SYNOPSIS
    The compliant contrast to the two functions above.

    .DESCRIPTION
    Demonstrates the patterns the standards ask for: an approved verb with a
    singular noun, a mandatory parameter without a redundant validator,
    correlation ID tracking, $_ in the catch block, and a PSTypeName-stamped
    output object. Passes PSScriptAnalyzer clean.

    .PARAMETER TestName
    Name of the test to run

    .PARAMETER CorrelationId
    Correlation ID for tracing; generated when not supplied

    .EXAMPLE
    Get-TestResult -TestName "SecurityTest"

    Runs the specified test and returns the result.

    .OUTPUTS
    TestResult. Returns test execution results.

    [CmdletBinding()]

    # output object below, not a .NET type - [OutputType([TestResult])] fails to resolve.
