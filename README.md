Enterprise-grade PowerShell development standards, shipped as GitHub Copilot instructions and Claude Code
rules, for consistent, secure, and high-quality PowerShell code across teams and projects.

> **Target versions** (verified 2026-08-01): **PowerShell 7.6 (LTS)** is the default target,
> supported through 14-Nov-2028. Windows PowerShell 5.1 remains supported as a compatibility
> target. **PowerShell 7.4 and 7.5 both reach end of support on 10-Nov-2026** — plan upgrades now.
> See [powershell-version.instructions.md](.github/instructions/powershell-version.instructions.md)
> for the full lifecycle table, version-gated features, and breaking changes.

## 📋 What's Included

### 🤖 GitHub Copilot Integration

- **Main Instructions**: Comprehensive enterprise PowerShell standards
- **Prompt Files**: Quick-access prompts for common tasks
- **Variable Prompts**: Interactive code generation
- **Quality Gates**: Automated validation and enforcement

### 🧠 Claude Code Integration

- **Always-On Rule**: `.claude/rules/powershell-standards/copilot-instructions.md` imports the main
  instructions, so every Claude Code session starts with the standards
- **Path-Scoped Rules**: the other files in that folder mirror each instruction file with the same globs
  as its `applyTo`, so a standard loads only when Claude works on a matching file
- **Synced Like Everything Else**: the sync workflow and installer mirror the rules folder, and never
  touch a project's own `CLAUDE.md`
- **Single Source**: The `.github/` files are the only copy. The Claude files reference them, never
  restate them

### 📚 PowerShell Standards

- **Version Baseline**: PowerShell 7.6 (LTS) targeting, with the support lifecycle, version-gated
  cmdlets, and breaking changes for 7.5/7.6 documented in one place
- **Community Best Practices**: Integrated PowerShell community guidelines
- **Enterprise Security**: Audit logging, credential handling, and data-classification patterns
  covering controls that SOX, GDPR, and HIPAA programmes commonly ask for
- **Performance Optimization**: Memory management and pipeline efficiency, including the
  version-dependent `+=` guidance that changed in PowerShell 7.5
- **Modern Tooling**: `Install-PSResource` (Microsoft.PowerShell.PSResourceGet) over PowerShellGet
  v2, with a capability check for Windows PowerShell 5.1 fallback
- **Testing Standards**: Pester 6.2 patterns — `Should-*` assertions, custom assertions via
  `New-ShouldAssertion`, `BeforeDiscovery` data, self-contained test files, and 13 supporting guides
  covering mocking, CI, and templates

### 🛠️ Development Tools

- **Project Templates**: Module, script collection, and application templates
- **Validation Scripts**: Automated standards compliance checking
- **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps templates
- **Troubleshooting Guides**: Organized problem-solving documentation

## 🎯 Key Features

### ✨ Automatic Code Generation

- **Enterprise Functions**: Complete functions with security, error handling, and documentation
- **Module Scaffolding**: Full module structure with tests and documentation
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated quality gates and deployment workflows

### 🔒 Security by Design

- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive sanitization and validation patterns
- **Credential Management**: SecretManagement integration and secure handling
- **Regulatory Patterns**: Audit-trail, consent, and access-control patterns for SOX, GDPR, and
  HIPAA work. These are code patterns and review prompts — they support a compliance programme but
  do not constitute one, and none of it substitutes for your own controls, evidence, and audit
- **Security Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection

### 📊 Quality Assurance

- **Code Analysis**: Comprehensive quality assessment tools
- **Performance Testing**: Automated benchmarking and optimization
- **Documentation Standards**: PlatyPS-generated command help, comment-based help, README generation
- **Community Compliance**: PowerShell best practices enforcement

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Enable Copilot Instructions

Current VS Code picks these up with no configuration: `.github/copilot-instructions.md` is applied
automatically, `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` apply to files matching their `applyTo`
glob, and `.github/prompts/*.prompt.md` are available as `/prompt-name` in Copilot Chat.

You only need settings if you keep these files somewhere other than the defaults:

```json
{
  "chat.instructionsFilesLocations": { ".github/instructions": true },
  "chat.promptFilesLocations": { ".github/prompts": true }
}
```

> Older guidance recommended `chat.promptFiles` and
> `github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.useInstructionFiles`. Settings-based instructions were
> deprecated in VS Code 1.102 in favour of the file-based layout above; neither setting is required
> now.

### 2. Enable Claude Code

Nothing to configure either. Claude Code discovers `.claude/rules/` recursively. The always-on rule in
`.claude/rules/powershell-standards/` imports `.github/copilot-instructions.md` at launch, and each
path-scoped rule imports one instruction file when Claude touches a matching file. The rules import
rather than copy, so there is one set of standards to maintain. Run `/memory` inside Claude Code to
see what is loaded.

The installer and the sync workflow mirror that rules folder into consuming projects along with the
`.github/` files and the examples. A project's own `CLAUDE.md` and any other rules it keeps under
`.claude/rules/` are never touched.

### 3. Choose Your Integration Method

#### Option A: Template Repository (New Projects)

1. Click "Use this template" above
2. Create your new repository
3. Start developing with standards automatically applied

#### Option B: Git Submodule (Existing Projects)

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/fadwen/ai-powershell-standards.git .copilot-standards
```

#### Option C: Direct Copy (Simple Projects)

```powershell
./Tools/Install-CopilotStandards.ps1 -ProjectPath "." -StandardsType "Basic"
```

#### Option D: Direct Copy, Kept in Sync (Recommended)

Options A through C copy the instruction files once. They then drift as this repository moves on.
Adding `-IncludeSyncWorkflow` also installs a weekly job that mirrors the instruction files and
opens a pull request when they fall behind:

```powershell
./Tools/Install-CopilotStandards.ps1 -ProjectPath "." -StandardsType "Basic" -IncludeSyncWorkflow
```

The workflow needs **Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions → "Allow GitHub Actions to
create and approve pull requests"** enabled on the target repository, and it overwrites local edits
to the mirrored paths. See [Templates/Workflows/](Templates/Workflows/README.md) for both caveats in
full.

### 4. Verify Setup

```powershell
# Test standards compliance
./Tools/Test-StandardsCompliance.ps1 -Path "."

# Create your first function using Copilot
# In VS Code, type: /new-function
```

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Quick Function Creation

```powershell
# Use the new-function prompt in Copilot Chat
/new-function
# Copilot will prompt for: function name, purpose, parameters
# Generates complete enterprise-standard function with tests
```

### Security Review

```powershell
# Select PowerShell code, then use security-review prompt
/security-review
# Comprehensive security analysis with compliance validation
```

### Performance Optimization

```powershell
# Select code that needs optimization
/optimize-performance
# Get specific optimization recommendations with benchmarks
```

## 🧪 Testing and Quality

### Automated Testing

Standards for the code you generate — Pester 6.2 throughout:

- **Unit Tests**: Pester tests targeting 80%+ coverage
- **Integration Tests**: External dependency validation
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmarking and regression detection
- **Security Tests**: Input validation and credential handling

### Quality Gates

These run against this repository on every pull request, and the templates set the same gates up
for yours:

- **PSScriptAnalyzer**: Zero errors in production files (test files are analyzed separately, since
  patterns like a hardcoded `-ComputerName 'MOCKSERVER'` are legitimate in a mock)
- **Pester**: Fails on `FailedCount` _and_ `FailedContainersCount` — a file that fails discovery
  contributes zero failed tests and would otherwise read green
- **Coverage**: Measured over `Tools/` and `powershell-standards/Examples/`, the code this repository ships
  and holds up as exemplary. Templates are excluded: they are scaffolding to copy, so covering a
  placeholder measures nothing
- **Security Scanning**: Credential leak and vulnerability detection. Secret patterns apply to all
  files; code-execution patterns apply only to `.ps1`/`.psm1`, since a `.psd1` is restricted data
  and cannot invoke a cmdlet
- **Documentation**: markdownlint over all Markdown, plus comment-based help validation
- **Community Standards**: PowerShell best practices compliance

## 🔧 Customization

### Team-Specific Instructions

Create `.instructions.md` files in your project for team-specific standards:

```markdown
---
applyTo: "**/*.ps1"
---
# Team-specific PowerShell standards
- Use specific naming conventions for your domain
- Include team-specific validation patterns
- Reference team tools and processes
```

### Project-Specific Prompts

Add custom prompts for your specific use cases:

```markdown
---
mode: 'agent'
description: 'Creates infrastructure automation function'
---
Create function for infrastructure management with:
- SCOM integration
- ServiceNow ticket correlation
- Active Directory validation
```

## 📊 Measuring Adoption

No benchmark study backs this repository, so it makes no claims about what adopting it will do for
your team. Measure it in your own environment instead — the quality gates emit most of what you
need:

- **PSScriptAnalyzer findings** per pull request, split by severity
- **Test coverage** and pass rate from the Pester gate
- **Security scan findings** — hardcoded secrets and unsafe patterns caught before merge
- **Documentation completeness** — comment-based help present on exported functions, markdownlint
  clean

Track these before and after adoption if you want a real before/after comparison.
