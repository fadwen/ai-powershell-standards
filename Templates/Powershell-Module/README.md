### Generating Command Help

This template ships without `docs/` or `en-US/` because both are generated. Once your public
functions exist, seed the Markdown from their comment-based help:

```powershell
Install-PSResource -Name Microsoft.PowerShell.PlatyPS
Import-Module ./ModuleName.psd1 -Force

New-MarkdownCommandHelp -ModuleInfo (Get-Module ModuleName) -OutputFolder ./docs -WithModulePage
```

From that point the Markdown under `docs/ModuleName/` is the source you edit, and each public
function gets `.EXTERNALHELP ModuleName-Help.xml` added as the first entry inside its `<# #>` block,
while the rest of the block shrinks to a one-line `.SYNOPSIS`. **Add that keyword only after the
first generation** — it suppresses comment-based help, so adding it earlier means PlatyPS has no
prose to seed from.
